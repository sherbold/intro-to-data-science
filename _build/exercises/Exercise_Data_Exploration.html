<p>This exercise is for the data exploration and your task is to understand a data set based on the description, statistics, and from visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="Data-for-this-exercise">Data for this exercise<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-for-this-exercise"> </a></h2><p>We use the boston house price data in this exercise. The data is available as part of <code>sklearn</code> for <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets">Python</a>. The description of the data is provided together with the actual data and should be the starting point for your analysis of the data.</p>
<h2 id="Descriptive-statistics-of-the-boston-data">Descriptive statistics of the boston data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Descriptive-statistics-of-the-boston-data"> </a></h2><p>Explore the boston data using descriptive statistics. Calculate the central tendency with the mean and median, the variability through the standard deviation and the IQR, as well as the range of the data. The real task is understanding something about the data from these results. For example, what can you learn about the CRIM feature from the mean and the median?</p>

<h2 id="Visualizations">Visualizations<a class="anchor-link" href="#Visualizations"> </a></h2><p>The Python library <code>matplotlib</code> is great for creating all kinds of visualizations. There are even libraries on top of <code>matplotlib</code> that facilitate relatively complex visualizations in a single line of code like <code>seaborn</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Analyze-single-features-of-the-boston-data">Analyze single features of the boston data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Analyze-single-features-of-the-boston-data"> </a></h3><p>Visually analyze features <code>zn</code> and <code>indus</code> of the boston data. Use the techniques described in Chapter 3, i.e., histograms and density plots (with/without rugs). What can you learn about these features from these plots? What are the advantages and drawbacks of the different plots for this data?</p>

First, analyze their relationship through scatter plots. Then, create a heatmap of the correlations between the features. What did you learn about the data?</p>
