<p>This exercise sheet covers the following concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis Testing</li>
<li>Effect Sizes</li>
<li>Confidence Intervals</li>
</ul>
<p>With this exercise, you can learn more about statistics and apply hypothesis testing, effect sizes, and determine the confidence interval of an machine learning experiment.</p>
<h2 id="Data-and-Libraries">Data and Libraries<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-and-Libraries"> </a></h2><p>Your task in this exercise is to apply statistical tests to compare the performance of two classification models. You can find everything you need in <code>sklearn</code> and <code>scipy.stats</code>. For this exercise, we use the Iris data. The data is available in <code>sklearn</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Repeated-Training-with-Repeated-Sampling">Repeated Training with Repeated Sampling<a class="anchor-link" href="#Repeated-Training-with-Repeated-Sampling"> </a></h2><p>Train classification models with a 5-nearest neighbor classifier and random forest classifier (100 estimators) for the Iris data using  5 different randomized train/test-splits with 50% data as training data. Calculate Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for each of these classifiers and create two arrays: one with the MCC values of the nearest neighbor classifier and one for the random forest.</p>

<h2 id="Statistical-Comparison">Statistical Comparison<a class="anchor-link" href="#Statistical-Comparison"> </a></h2><p>Compare the summary statistics mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max of the estimates for the MCC of both classifiers. Use statistical tests to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the classifiers. If the difference is significant, use Cohen's $d$ to estimate the effect size. Moreover, calculate the confidence interval for the mean value of MCC to estimate the reliability of your performance estimation.</p>
<p>Repeat all of the above with 10, 50, and 100 train/test splits. How do the results depend on the number of repetitions?</p>
